# 🎮 Return to Sender

Recover stolen artifacts before the museum opens… but beware, something’s lurking.

Developed in Unity with C#, Return to Sender is a prototype game where players must navigate a museum after hours, solve puzzles, and return artifacts to their rightful places — all while avoiding mysterious entities called Echoes.

# 🕹️ Game Concept

Set in a museum after hours, Return to Sender challenges the player to:

Recover stolen cultural artifacts using only a flashlight.

Explore different rooms and solve interactive puzzles.

Evade Echoes — enemies that only move when not exposed to light.

Race against time before the museum reopens.

The goal: strategic movement, quick problem-solving, and survival under pressure.

# 🌍 Inspiration

The concept draws from:

Black Panther (2018) — inspired by Killmonger's confrontation about stolen artifacts.

Real-world history — artifacts like the Benin Bronzes, seized in the 1897 Benin Expedition.

Persistent enemy mechanics — Echoes (visualized as British soldiers), representing unethical artifact acquisition practices.

This fusion of cultural storytelling and gameplay mechanics creates a meaningful experience around history, justice, and survival.
